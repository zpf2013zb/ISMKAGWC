%CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel type of queries, namely, KaGWC query. Although CoSKQ can retrieve a group of objects to collectively satisfy the users' needs, however, these exsiting works regardless of the crucial level information of keyword. BKC \cite{deng2015best} considers the rating information, but different with ours in query goal. To address this novel problem, we design two approximation algorithms, namely, CubeTree and MaxMargin with provable approximation ratio. Besides, we also propose an exact algorithm MergeList for this problem. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets were conducted to verify the performance of our proposed algorithms. In a nutshell, both CubeTree and MaxMargin run much faster than the MergeList. CubeTree runs slightly faster than MaxMargin, however, MaxMargin with better performance than CubeTree in terms of accuracy and stability of approximation ratio.

In the future work, there are several interesting research directions. One is to research the KaGWC problem in the road network scenario. Another direction is to take multidimensional level information of keyword into consideration, which can provide the user more appropriate query result. It is also interesting to study other forms of cost function for this problem.
